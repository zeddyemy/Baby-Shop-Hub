BabyShopHub is a cross-platform mobile application designed to provide a convenient and reliable shopping experience for parents and caregivers. The app will offer a wide range of infant products, from diapers and clothing to toys and food, all within a secure and user-friendly interface.

**Primary Objectives:**

- To provide a real-life implementation project for applying Flutter development skills.

- To create a fully-functional e-commerce mobile app prototype.

- To implement core features including user authentication, product browsing, cart management, and order processing.

- To ensure the application meets defined non-functional requirements like performance, security, and usability.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

- Performance:

    - The app should launch in under 3 seconds on average mid-range devices.

    - All user interactions (button presses, navigation) should have visual feedback within 1-2 seconds.

- Usability & Accessibility:

    - The UI must be intuitive and follow Material Design 3 (for Android) and Cupertino (for iOS) guidelines for a native feel.

    - Fonts and interactive elements must be of adequate size and contrast for clarity.

- Reliability & Error Handling:

    - The app must handle network failures gracefully (e.g., show retry options, cached data).

    - Clear and user-friendly error messages must be displayed for any operation failures (e.g., login incorrect, product not found).

- Security:

    - User passwords must be hashed and stored securely (using Firebase Auth).

    - Features like viewing order history and checkout must be protected and only accessible to authenticated users.

- Scalability:

    - The backend (Firebase) should be chosen for its ability to scale automatically with user growth.

    - Cloud Firestore: To store and sync product data, user profiles, orders, and reviews in real-time.

    - Firebase Storage: For storing product images.

- Additional Packages:

    - cached_network_image: For efficient image loading and caching.

    - flutter_rating_bar: For displaying and capturing star ratings.

    - provider or flutter_bloc: For state management.

## 5. Deliverables

1. Source Code: Complete, well-documented, and formatted Dart code in a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).

2. Application: A working APK (Android) and/or IPA (iOS) file of the final product.

3. Documentation:

    - User Documentation: A simple guide or in-app tooltips explaining key features.

    - Developer Documentation: Code comments and a README.md file explaining how to set up the development environment, run the app, and the project structure.

4. Video Demo: A short screen recording (3-5 minutes) demonstrating the complete flow of the application, covering all major features from registration to placing an order.

**Next Steps**

- Set up the Flutter development environment.

- Begin UI/UX wireframing for key screens (Splash, Login, Home, Product List, Product Detail, Cart, Checkout).


- Implement the core data models (User, Product, CartItem, Order) Use mock data temporarily while building.

- Create a new Firebase project and configure it for the app.

- Start development by integrating Firebase Auth and building the authentication flow.
